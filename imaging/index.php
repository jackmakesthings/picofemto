			<p class="font-24 light">Perhaps no other field of medicine has evolved over the course of the past two decades than imaging—from fMRI cardiac analysis to DTI neuroimaging.  Radiologists and physicians reviewing these imaging modalities today must have access to a sophisticated array of tools to deal with increasingly complex biomedical data.  At Picofemto, one of our core missions is to revolutionize this area of medicine by providing cloud based visualization and analysis tools that help physicians become more efficient, reduce false negative and positive rates, and to reduce the cost of healthcare delivery.  These are ambitious goals, and to deliver on this vision for imaging, we have assembled a cutting-edge team from physicians to physicists to software developers who each eagerly share in this vision.
			We will be releasing our first imaging product, CliniscanSM MR Decision Support, in the latter half of 2014.</p>

				<p class="reg-400">MRIs, once relatively expensive and experimental, is already setting the standard in clinical medical imaging, partly driven by demand, high reliability and ever increasing levels of hardware sophistication. More recently, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, also known as DTI, or D-MRI, has grown in popularity - it allows the radiologist to examine the white matter circuitry in the central nervous system (CNS). DTI applications include mild and traumatic brain injury, epileptic manifestations and pre-surgical planning to name but a few.</p>

				<p class="reg-400">One can remember the days when the radiologist would be staring at one printed X-ray image on film. These days are fading away. All data is now digitized. The bulk and complexity of medical images does not allow the radiologist to spend as much time on a single slice as before. For example, a brain MRI can consist of a series of 150 images. From a 2D stack of images of a biological structure, regions of interest can be isolated offline for 2D, 3D and 4D processing, visualization, anomaly detection and clinical correlation.</p>

				<p class="reg-400">Without impeding on a radiologist’s current workflow, Cliniscan is intended to act as a decision support system for reading and highlighting areas of interest in MRIs and DTIs. DTIs are especially suited to our analysis machine due to the sheer machine power required for detection and description of anomalies. Integrable with current Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS), Cliniscan leverages processing and storage power of cloud computing to virtually any location on the planet with internet. Sharing and collaborating among physicians is made seamless at the click of a mouse button. Not only do patients not have to worry about follow up studies, they can even rely on longitudinal analysis of their medical metadata as well as integration of multiple modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG), and positron emission tomography (PET).</p>
